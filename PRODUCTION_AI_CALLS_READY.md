2. **Q4 source outreach** - 18 contacts ready
3. **Aicall** - 19 contacts ready

### Step 4: Start Automated Calls
1. Click on your campaign
2. Click the **"Start Automated Calls"** button
3. Select phone number: **18058690081**

### Step 5: Monitor Live Calls
1. Navigate to **"Live Monitor"** page
2. Watch AI calls happen in real-time
3. See conversations as they unfold
4. Monitor emotion and intent analysis

## 📱 What Happens When You Start

1. **Queue Service** picks the next contact from your campaign
2. **Asterisk** dials the customer via Telnyx SIP
3. **AI Agent** greets the customer with TTS (text-to-speech)
4. **Customer speaks** → Vosk STT transcribes in real-time
5. **AI processes** the conversation using your campaign script
6. **Live Monitor** displays everything in real-time via WebSocket
7. **Conversation saved** to database for later review

## 🎯 AI Conversation Features

✅ **Human-like greeting** with customer's name
✅ **Active listening** - transcribes everything customer says
✅ **Intelligent responses** - follows your campaign script
✅ **Objection handling** - price, timing, competitor concerns
✅ **Emotion detection** - adapts tone based on customer mood
✅ **Intent recognition** - detects buying signals
✅ **DNC compliance** - auto-adds to Do Not Call list on request
✅ **Graceful endings** - polite conversation closure

## 📊 Real-Time Monitoring

### Live Monitor Shows:
- 🟢 **Active calls** - all ongoing AI conversations
- 💬 **Live conversation** - messages appear instantly
- 😊 **Emotion tracking** - interested, frustrated, neutral, etc.
- 🎯 **Intent detection** - buying signal, objection, question, etc.
- ⏱️  **Duration** - live call timer
- 💰 **Cost** - real-time cost tracking

### Call History Shows:
- 📝 **Complete transcripts** - full conversation text
- 📊 **Call analytics** - duration, outcome, emotion
- 🔍 **Searchable** - find calls by contact name or phone
- 📥 **Exportable** - download call records

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

```
Frontend (React)
    ↓ WebSocket
Backend (Node.js)
    ↓ FastAGI (port 4573)
Asterisk
    ↓ SIP
Telnyx → Customer Phone
```

### Call Flow:
1. Queue Service creates call record
2. Asterisk ARI initiates outbound call
3. On answer, routes to FastAGI server
4. Node.js AGI handler:
   - Plays TTS greeting
   - Records customer speech
   - Transcribes with Vosk STT
   - Processes with conversation engine
   - Broadcasts to WebSocket
   - Repeats conversation loop
5. On hangup, saves full transcript

## 🐛 Known Issues (Non-Critical)

1. **Asterisk shows "unhealthy"** in Docker
   - ⚠️  Cosmetic issue - health check timeout
   - ✅ Asterisk is actually working fine
   - No action needed

2. **Asterisk hostname resolution**
   - ⚠️  Backend can't resolve "asterisk" from inside container
   - ✅ Uses "localhost" for FastAGI instead
   - No impact on functionality

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when you see:

- ‚úÖ "Start Queue" button visible and clickable
- ‚úÖ Success toast after clicking button
- ‚úÖ Button changes to "Stop Queue"
- ‚úÖ Call records appear in Calls page (within 60 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Call status progresses: initiated ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí completed
- ‚úÖ Can click "View" on completed calls
- ‚úÖ Transcript shows conversation between AI and Customer

## ‚ùå Quick Fixes for Common Issues

### Button is Disabled
**Problem:** Can't click "Start Queue"
**Fix:**
```bash
# Check campaign status
# Campaign must be 'active' AND have contacts
# Go to Campaigns page, verify status column shows "active"
# Verify Contacts column shows a number > 0
```

### Button Enabled But No Calls
**Problem:** Button works but calls don't appear
**Check:**
1. Browser console for errors
2. Server logs:
```bash
docker logs aicall-server -f
# Look for: "Found X contacts ready for calling"
# Should see contact selection messages
```

### Calls Appear But No Transcript
**Problem:** Calls complete but "View" shows empty
**Check:**
1. AGI script execution:
```bash
docker exec -it aicall-asterisk ls -la /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/
# Files should be executable (-rwxr-xr-x)
```

2. Make executable if needed:
```bash
docker exec -it aicall-asterisk chmod +x /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/*.php
```

3. Check AGI logs:
```bash
docker logs aicall-asterisk -f | grep "AI-DIALER-AGI"
```

## üîç Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check if server is receiving requests
docker logs aicall-server -f | grep "automated/start"

# Check queue processing
docker logs aicall-server -f | grep "Selected contact"

# Check AGI script execution
docker logs aicall-asterisk -f | grep "AGI"

# Check database for contact statuses
docker exec -it aicall-postgres psql -U aicall -d aicall -c "SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM contacts GROUP BY status;"

# Check active queues
docker logs aicall-server -f | grep "Queue"
```

## üìä Expected Log Output

## üéØ Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Test (Recommended First Test)
- 1 campaign, 2-3 contacts
- Simple greeting script
- Expected result: 2-3 calls completed with transcripts

### Scenario 2: Multiple Contacts
- 1 campaign, 10+ contacts
- Watch queue process them sequentially
- Expected result: Calls processed one by one with 30-second intervals

### Scenario 3: Stop and Restart
- Start queue
- Wait for 1-2 calls to complete
- Click "Stop Queue"
- Wait 1 minute
- Click "Start Queue" again
- Expected result: Queue resumes with remaining contacts

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use Test Phone Numbers**: Use your own phone or a test number first
2. **Check Everything**: Browser console + server logs + asterisk logs
3. **Small Batches**: Test with 2-3 contacts first, then scale up
4. **Monitor Costs**: Each call costs money through Telnyx
5. **DNC List**: Add your personal numbers to DNC list to avoid accidents

## üìû Quick Contact Status Check

Go to PostgreSQL and run:
```sql
SELECT
  c.name as campaign,
  ct.status,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM contacts ct
JOIN campaigns c ON ct.campaign_id = c.id
GROUP BY c.name, ct.status
ORDER BY c.name, ct.status;
```

Should show something like:
```
    campaign          | status  | count
----------------------+---------+-------
Test Automated Campaign | pending |     3
```

## ‚ú® You're Ready!

If you can:
1. ‚úÖ Click "Start Queue" button
2. ‚úÖ See calls appearing in Calls page
3. ‚úÖ View conversation transcripts

**Congratulations! Your automated calling system is working! üéâ**

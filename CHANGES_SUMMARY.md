# AI Automated Calls - Changes Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. **Removed PHP AGI Scripts** ❌→✅
Removed all PHP-based AGI scripts to eliminate conflicts and use Node.js exclusively:
- Deleted: `server/asterisk/ai-dialer-simplified.php`
- Deleted: `server/asterisk/ai-dialer-agi-simple.php`
- Deleted: `server/asterisk/ai-dialer-agi.php`
- Deleted: `server/asterisk/ai-dialer-hangup-agi.php`
- Deleted: `server/asterisk/ai-inbound-agi.php`

### 2. **Updated Asterisk Extensions** 🔧
Modified `asterisk-config/extensions.conf`:
- Changed `ai-dialer-stasis` context to use FastAGI: `agi://atsservices:4573`
- Removed PHP AGI script references
- Ensured dialplan calls Node.js FastAGI server exclusively

### 3. **Fixed Conversation WebSocket Broadcasts** 📡
Updated `server/routes/conversation-simple.js`:
- Added WebSocket broadcasting for each conversation turn
- Broadcasts to organization channel in real-time
- Ensures LiveMonitor receives conversation updates immediately

### 4. **Fixed LiveMonitor Frontend** 🖥️
Updated `client/src/pages/LiveMonitor.js`:
- Handle both `callId` and `call_id` field names
- Handle both `userInput`/`user_input` and `aiResponse`/`ai_response` fields
- Improved real-time conversation display
- Fixed WebSocket event handling for conversation turns

### 5. **Verified System Components** ✓
Confirmed all components are working together:
- ✅ Queue System: Creates calls and initiates via telephony
- ✅ Telephony Provider: Uses ARI to originate calls
- ✅ Stasis App: Handles call lifecycle, sets variables, continues to dialplan
- ✅ FastAGI Server: Listening on port 4573, handles AGI protocol
- ✅ AI Conversation Handler: Manages complete conversation flow
- ✅ Conversation Engine: Processes turns, broadcasts via WebSocket
- ✅ Database: Saves conversation turns and aggregates transcripts

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Automated Call Flow (Node.js Only)
```
Campaign Queue
    ↓
Queue System (creates call in DB)
    ↓
Telephony Service (startOutboundCall)
    ↓
Asterisk ARI (originates call to ai-dialer-stasis app)
    ↓
Stasis App Manager (receives call, sets variables)
    ↓
Asterisk Dialplan (executes AGI command)
    ↓
FastAGI Server (port 4573)
    ↓
AI Conversation Handler
    ├── Answer call
    ├── Get greeting from conversation engine
    ├── Play TTS to customer
    ├── Record customer response
    ├── Transcribe with STT
    ├── Process with AI conversation engine
    │   └── [BROADCASTS VIA WEBSOCKET] 📡
    ├── Play AI response
    └── Repeat until call ends
        ↓
Stasis App (on channel destroyed)
    ├── Aggregate transcript from call_events
    ├── Update call status to 'completed'
    ├── Save transcript to calls table
    └── Broadcast call_ended event 📡
```

### Real-Time Display (WebSocket)
```
Backend (conversation-simple.js)
    ↓
WebSocket Broadcaster
    ↓
Frontend LiveMonitor (subscribed to organization)
    ↓
Active Calls Section
    ├── Shows call in real-time
    ├── Click to view conversation
    └── Conversation updates live as turns happen
```

### Call History
```
Call completes
    ↓
Stasis App aggregates transcript
    ↓
Saves to calls.transcript column
    ↓
Frontend Call History displays full conversation
```

## 📝 Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# FastAGI Server
AGI_PORT=4573
AGI_HOST=atsservices

# ARI Connection
ARI_URL=http://asterisk:8088/ari
ARI_USERNAME=ai-dialer
ARI_PASSWORD=ai-dialer-password

# Queue Settings
MAX_CONCURRENT_CALLS=5
CALL_INTERVAL_MS=30000
MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3

# API Internal URL (for AGI callbacks)
API_INTERNAL_URL=http://atsservices:3000
```

### Asterisk Configuration
File: `asterisk-config/extensions.conf`
```
[ai-dialer-stasis]
exten => s,1,NoOp(AI Dialer: Starting AI call)
 same => n,Set(CALL_START_TIME=${EPOCH})
 same => n,Answer()
 same => n,Wait(1)
 same => n,AGI(agi://atsservices:4573,${CALL_ID},${CONTACT_PHONE},${CAMPAIGN_ID})
 same => n,Hangup()
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Automated Test
```bash
cd /path/to/aicall
node test-automated-call-flow.js
```

This test will:
1. ✅ Authenticate
2. ✅ Create test campaign
3. ✅ Create test contact
4. ✅ Start queue
5. ✅ Monitor call progress
6. ✅ Verify conversation recorded
7. ✅ Check transcript saved
8. ✅ Cleanup test data

### Manual Testing
1. **Start Services**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Create Campaign**
   - Login to frontend
   - Navigate to Campaigns
   - Create new campaign
   - Set status to 'active'

3. **Add Contacts**
   - Navigate to campaign
   - Add contacts (CSV upload or manual)
   - Ensure contacts have valid phone numbers

4. **Start Queue**
   - Go to campaign dashboard
   - Click "Start Queue"
   - Monitor progress

5. **Watch LiveMonitor**
   - Navigate to Live Monitor page
   - See calls appear in Active Calls
   - Click on call to view conversation
   - Watch conversation update in real-time

6. **Check Call History**
   - Navigate to Call History
   - View completed calls
   - See full transcripts

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: No calls being initiated
**Check:**
- ✅ Queue started: `/api/v1/queue/status/:campaignId`
- ✅ Contacts in pending status
- ✅ Phone number assigned to campaign
- ✅ Daily limit not reached
- ✅ Asterisk running: `docker-compose ps asterisk`
- ✅ ARI connection: Check server logs for "Connected to Asterisk ARI"

### Issue: Calls initiated but no conversation
**Check:**
- ✅ FastAGI server running: Check logs for "FastAGI Server listening on 0.0.0.0:4573"
- ✅ Asterisk can reach FastAGI: `docker exec asterisk ping atsservices`
- ✅ Extensions.conf correct: `AGI(agi://atsservices:4573,...)`
- ✅ Call reaches Stasis app: Check asterisk logs

### Issue: Conversation not showing in LiveMonitor
**Check:**
- ✅ WebSocket connected: Green indicator in header
- ✅ Subscribed to organization: Check browser console
- ✅ conversation-simple.js broadcasting: Check server logs
- ✅ Frontend handling events: Check console for "💬 Conversation turn"

### Issue: Transcript not saved
**Check:**
- ✅ call_events table has 'ai_conversation' entries: `SELECT * FROM call_events WHERE event_type='ai_conversation'`
- ✅ Stasis app aggregating on call end: Check logs for "Call completed with outcome"
- ✅ calls.transcript field populated: `SELECT id, transcript FROM calls WHERE id='...'`

## 🎉 Benefits of Node.js-Only Flow

1. **No PHP Dependencies**: Simpler deployment, fewer moving parts
2. **Consistent Codebase**: Everything in JavaScript/TypeScript
3. **Better Error Handling**: Node.js async/await patterns
4. **Real-Time WebSocket**: Integrated seamlessly with existing WebSocket infrastructure
5. **Easier Debugging**: Single language, better logging
6. **Maintainability**: One codebase to maintain, not two

## 📚 Documentation

- **Architecture**: See `AUTOMATED_CALLS_NODEJS_FLOW.md`
- **Testing**: See `test-automated-call-flow.js`
- **API Docs**: See existing API documentation
- **Database Schema**: See migration scripts in `server/scripts/migrations/`

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Deploy**: Use existing deployment scripts (no changes needed)
2. **Configure**: Set environment variables
3. **Test**: Run test script
4. **Monitor**: Watch LiveMonitor for real-time calls
5. **Optimize**: Tune scripts and knowledge base for better conversations

---

**Summary**: The automated call system now uses **Node.js FastAGI exclusively** with real-time WebSocket broadcasting for live conversation monitoring. All PHP scripts have been removed. The system is cleaner, more maintainable, and fully integrated.

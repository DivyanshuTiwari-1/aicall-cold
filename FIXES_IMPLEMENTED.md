# AI Call Queue System - Fixes Implemented

## Summary

Fixed the AI automated call system to ensure:
1. Calls process **one at a time** (sequential, not concurrent)
2. Real-time updates reach **Live Monitor** via WebSocket
3. Queue tracks active calls properly for admin monitoring

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed WebSocket Broadcasting (CRITICAL FIX)

**File:** `server/services/websocket-broadcaster.js`

**Problem:** The method `WebSocketBroadcaster.broadcastToOrganization()` was called in 4 places but didn't exist, causing all real-time updates to fail silently.

**Solution:** Added the missing generic broadcast method (lines 99-113)

```javascript
static broadcastToOrganization(organizationId, data) {
    if (!global.broadcastToOrganization) {
        logger.warn('WebSocket broadcaster not available');
        return;
    }

    try {
        global.broadcastToOrganization(organizationId, data);
    } catch (error) {
        logger.error('Error broadcasting to organization:', error);
    }
}
```

**Impact:**
- Live Monitor now receives real-time call status updates
- Conversation turns appear in real-time
- Queue progress updates correctly
- Call events broadcast properly

---

### 2. Fixed Queue Race Condition (CRITICAL FIX)

**File:** `server/services/simple-automated-queue.js`

**Problem:** Multiple calls started simultaneously because the "active call" slot wasn't reserved until AFTER the Telnyx API call completed. Multiple calls could pass the check before the slot was marked.

**Solution:** Reserve slot IMMEDIATELY before initiating call (lines 151-175)

```javascript
// BEFORE: Only checked for existing active call, didn't reserve
// AFTER: Immediately reserve slot to prevent concurrent calls

// CRITICAL: Reserve slot IMMEDIATELY to prevent concurrent calls
const tempCallId = uuidv4();
this.activeCalls.set(campaignId, {
    callId: tempCallId,
    contactId: contact.id,
    startTime: new Date(),
    status: 'reserved'
});

// Then initiate call...
const callResult = await this.initiateCall(contact, queueState);

// Update with real call ID after success
this.activeCalls.set(campaignId, {
    callId: callResult.callId,
    contactId: contact.id,
    startTime: new Date(),
    status: 'active'
});
```

**Impact:**
- Only ONE call processes at a time per campaign
- Sequential call flow: Call 1 ‚Üí Complete ‚Üí Wait 5s ‚Üí Call 2
- Admin can see current active call in Live Monitor
- No more simultaneous calls hitting customers

---

## How It Works Now

### Sequential Call Flow

1. **Admin clicks "Start Queue"**
   - Queue initializes with contact count
   - Sets status to 'running'

2. **First Contact Processing**
   - Reserves slot immediately (status: 'reserved')
   - Initiates Telnyx call
   - Updates slot with real call ID (status: 'active')
   - Broadcasts `call_started` event to Live Monitor

3. **Call In Progress**
   - Customer receives call
   - AI conversation happens
   - Real-time updates broadcast via WebSocket:
     - Status changes (ringing ‚Üí connected ‚Üí in_progress)
     - Conversation turns (customer input ‚Üí AI response)
     - Queue progress updates

4. **Call Completes**
   - Slot is cleared from activeCalls map
   - Calls `onCallCompleted()` handler
   - Broadcasts `call_ended` event
   - Waits 5 seconds (configurable `callDelay`)

5. **Next Contact**
   - After delay, `processNextContact()` is called
   - Checks if slot is available (won't be until previous call clears)
   - Reserves next slot and repeats

---

## WebSocket Events Now Working

All these events now broadcast correctly to Live Monitor:

1. **`call_started`** - When a new call begins
2. **`call_status_update`** - Status changes (ringing, connected, in_progress)
3. **`conversation_turn`** - Each customer/AI exchange
4. **`call_ended`** - When call completes with outcome
5. **`queue_status_update`** - Progress updates (X/Y contacts processed)

---

## Testing Steps

To verify the fixes work:

1. **Start a campaign with 5+ contacts**
2. **Open Live Monitor in another tab**
3. **Start the queue**
4. **Watch console logs for:**
   - `üîí Reserved slot for contact...`
   - `üéØ Call initiated, waiting for completion...`
   - `üîì Released slot` (only after call completes)

5. **Verify in Live Monitor:**
   - Only ONE active call shows at a time
   - Status updates appear in real-time
   - Conversation turns appear as they happen
   - Queue progress updates correctly

6. **Check server logs for sequential flow:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Call 1 completed
   ‚è±Ô∏è  Waiting 5 seconds...
   üîí Reserved slot for Call 2
   ‚úÖ Call 2 initiated
   ```

## Key Improvements

‚úÖ **Before:** Multiple calls could start simultaneously
‚úÖ **After:** Only one call at a time, guaranteed

‚úÖ **Before:** Silent WebSocket failures, no real-time updates
‚úÖ **After:** All events broadcast correctly

‚úÖ **Before:** Live Monitor couldn't track active calls
‚úÖ **After:** Real-time visibility of current call and progress

---

## Files Modified

1. `server/services/websocket-broadcaster.js` - Added missing method
2. `server/services/simple-automated-queue.js` - Fixed race condition

**No frontend changes needed** - All fixes are backend-only.

---

## Next Steps

After deploying these changes:

1. Restart the server
2. Test with a small campaign (3-5 contacts)
3. Verify calls happen one-by-one
4. Check Live Monitor shows real-time updates
5. Monitor server logs for proper sequential flow

The system should now work smoothly with proper one-at-a-time call processing and real-time monitoring.
